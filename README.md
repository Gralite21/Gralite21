Hi my name is Tim

I started programming in June 2023...

So I am an absolute beginner

In October 2023 I will start my Bachelor in Computer Science in the university Hochschule Bonn-Rein-Sieg

In the future I want to become a full stack developer who can also use Blender, design simple things and create his own games

But thats the future and currently I have no knowledge at all

I will mainly use Github to keep track of my progress and to show off my work to friends

Currently learning:  JavaScript, Css and HTML
