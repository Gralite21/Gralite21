Hi my name is Tim.
I started programming in June 2023...
So I am an absolute beginner
In October 2023 i will start my Bachelor in Computer Science in the university Hoschule Bonn-Rein-Sieg
In the future I want to become a full stack developer who can also use Blender, design simple things and create his own games
But thats the future and currently I have no knowledge at all

I will mainly use Github to keep track of my progress and to show of my work to friends

Currently learning: JavaScript and Blender
